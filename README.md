# Dentistry Patient Action Analysis - SmilePass

## Abstract
- This project is cold started with raw data and to be expected with innoivation ideas of from the limited data provided by the company of SmilePass
- As a registered research assistant for this project in MIE program U of T, I made weekly updates and report for my tasks and progress. This project is lead by Professor Chi-Guhn Lee and Doctor Dhavalkumar Patel. Ruiwu Liu and Prithvi Seran are my teammates who also worked as researcher for this project. Appraciate to them and all effort they have made.
- This project now include multiple task lines conducted based on the interests and requirment from the dentists. There are three main streams I'm working on, whcih are Co-occurence Analysis, Risk Level Analysis and Recommondation System.

## Co-occurence Analysis
- Focused on the procedure_code (Treatments) in a time window of 3 or 6 months
- Data mining for co-occurence and sequential occurence analysis.
- Apriori alogrithms is used to construct support and lift for treatments.
- Map code information with their descriptions and report with lift heatmap.

## Risk Level Analysis
- Develop risk map and health score system upon the data correspond to the treatment with data engineering for new features. 
- Perform correlation detection and feature importance analysis. 
- Automate this process and prepare for prediction of a certian treatment (e.g. Crowns, Root Canals)

## Recommondation System
- Generate data cleaning functions and encode the data
- Data Segmentation based on consistency
- Unsupervised ML model (clustering) on recommendation system
- Apply deep learning model on consistent groups
